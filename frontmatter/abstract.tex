Implementing secure Web and Mobile applications is a classic problem for many businesses. The rapid growth of connectivity, combined with the dramatic increase in the value of the data handled by these applications as well as the increasing use of new protocols and technologies have resulted in applications exposing both the organizations that are putting them in place as well as their users at significant risks.\\
Although the term « secure » is relatively relative, the fact remains that a certain degree of security is essential for these applications. To achieve this, an ideal approach is to consider security as an integral part of the project throughout its life cycle. Again, the parties should be aware of this and the resources to achieve this goal should be available.\\
This document is a late cycle memoir for obtaining the Design Engineering degree in Computer
Science. This presents the realization of a project carried out as part of an internship at HubSo. This project consists of the study and implementation of OWASP compliants Java EE web application and Android Mobile application.\\
We have designed a security features library that can be integrated into web and mobile applications. Our solution is based on a pre-existing open source API developed by OWASP, OWASP ESAPI. In addition, the library has been integrated with an existing application.\\
The library has been developed in Java SE and a developer guide has been proposed along with an OWASP compliant application architecture\\ \\
