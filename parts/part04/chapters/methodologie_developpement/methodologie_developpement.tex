\section{Qu'est ce qu'une méthodologie de développement ?}
A methodology formally defines the process that you use to gather requirements, analyze them, and design an application that meets them in every way. There are many methodologies, each differing in some way or ways from the others. There are many reasons why one methodology may be better than another for your particular project: For example, some are better suited for large enterprise applications while others are built to design small embedded or safety-critical systems. On another axis, some methods better support large numbers of architects and designers working on the same project, while others work better when used by one person or a small group
OMG, as a vendor-neutral organization, does not have an opinion about any methodology.
